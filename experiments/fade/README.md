# 3: Fades

finished: yes

made with GarageBand

---

An experiment in the usage of crossfades.

Beginning with a short and quickly repeating electric piano melody, a drum beat begins.
A bassline joins soon after, and then a melody.
Soon, everything disappears except fror the melody and the piano melody.
The main melody gets swapped out for a different instrument, and the background piano melody is replaced with a different one.
Then, everything crossfades into a section with rising notes, which then leads into a section with slower, more relaxed synths.
Then, the synths are replaced with noise as a simple beat begins, which suddenly then ends, leading to a final section with the original melodies.
