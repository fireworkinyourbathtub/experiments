# 4: Chicken

finished: yes

made with GarageBand

---

A track with a more pop-oriented verse-chorus structure, but still entirely instrumental. I started by writing the drum beat, and went along from there. It makes less sense from a harmonic standpoint, because it includes many notes whose pitches randomly selected.
