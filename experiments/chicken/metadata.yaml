description:
  A track with a more pop-oriented verse-chorus structure, but still entirely instrumental.
  I started by writing the drum beat, and went along from there.
  It makes less sense from a harmonic standpoint, because it includes many notes whose pitches randomly selected.

made-with: GarageBand
finished: true
