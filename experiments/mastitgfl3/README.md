# 2: My Amazing Song that is too Good for Life 3

finished: yes
made with GarageBand

After a bad, abandoned sequel, the threequel has a number of sections, starting with a piano intro.
Then comes a section with some things, which cuts to a simpler, more acoustic section with 3/4 over 4/4 polymeter
After that the trombones bring us into the next section with unaligned, seemingly random and chaotic drumming, as a piano plays a sports montage-esque inspirational tune.
Suddenly everything cuts out except for a drum playing a marching band rhythm, which leads into the next section that is more electronic, inspired by EDM
It builds up, and then winds down by removing instruments until all that is left are strings that are wildly glissandoing up and down.
This brings us into the final section with just a lonely piano and other ambient noises playing a quieter, more reflective melody. It eventually is replaced with distant bells and an annoying drone which finish the track creepily.
