My musical experiments

Sometimes I write songs, and these are all of them. They are all numbered and all have names as well.

PyYAML is needed to run the tracklist generation script.

*this README file is autogenerated. any modifications to the information here should be made to the `README_INFO` variable in the `generate_tracks.py` script*
